    <h3>Early Life</h3>
    <p>George Boole was born November 2, 1815, Lincoln, Lincolnshire, England. Boole was given his first lessons in mathematics by his his father, a tradesman, who also taught him how to make optical instruments. Boole was considered a prodigy and self-taught genius George first became intrested in mathematics as a tool to solve mechanical problems in his instrument making occasions.  His interest quickly blossomed and he soon began an elaborate project of self-education in mathematics. </p>
    <p>From the age of 16 he taught in village schools in the West Riding of Yorkshire and started his own school in Lincoln at age nineteen.  By his mid-twenties, he had mastered most of the important mathematical principles in his day. During scant leisure time he read mathematics journals in the Lincoln’s Mechanics Institute. There he also read Isaac Newton’s Principia, Pierre-Simon Laplace’s Traité de mécanique céleste, and Joseph-Louis Lagrange’s Mécanique analytique and began to solve advanced problems in algebra.</p>
    <p>Boole submitted a stream of original papers to the new Cambridge Mathematical Journal, beginning in 1839 with his “Researches on the Theory of Analytical Transformations.” These papers were on differential equations and the algebraic problem of linear transformation, emphasizing the concept of invariance. In 1841 he founded a new branch of mathematics called Invariant Theory. </p>
    <p>In 1844, in an important paper in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society for which he was awarded the Royal Society’s first gold medal for mathematics, he discussed how methods of algebra and calculus might be combined. Boole soon saw that his algebra could also be applied in logic.</p>
    <p>Developing novel ideas on logical method and confident in the symbolic reasoning he had derived from his mathematical investigations, he published in 1847 a pamphlet, “Mathematical Analysis of Logic”.  It was the ground-breaking work that laid the foundations for what is known today as Boolean algebra and the propositional calculus. It not only expanded on Gottfried Leibniz's earlier speculations on the correlation between logic and math, but argued that logic was principally a discipline of mathematics, rather than philosophy.</p>

    <p>In 1849 was appointed professor of mathematics at Queen’s College, County Cork, even though he had no university degree. In 1854 he published An Investigation into the Laws of Thought, on Which Are Founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities, which he regarded as a mature statement of his ideas. </p>
    <p>The next year he married Mary Everest, niece of Sir George Everest, for whom the mountain is named. The Booles had five daughters.</p>

    <h3>Religion</h3>
    <p> Boole was motivated in his research by his intense religious convictions. At the age of 17 he had a mystical experience in which he felt God called on him to explain how the mind processes thought. He decided to do this in a mathematical form, for the Glory of God.</p>

    <h3>Why is the Boolean algebra so important for computer science and digital circuitry?</h3>
    <p>Boolean algebra provides the basis for analyzing the validity of logical propositions because it captures the two-valued character (binary) of statements that may be either true or false. In the 1930s, a number of researchers noticed that Boole's two valued logic lent itself to a description of electrical switching circuits. They showed that the binary numbers (0 and 1), combined through Boolean algebra, could be used to analyze electrical switching circuits and thus used to design electronic computers. Today, digital computers and electronic circuits are designed to implement this binary arithmetic.</p>
    <p>George Boole's idea was revolutionary. Ironically, however, it was mostly criticized or ignored by his peers despite George Boole's great reputation. Charles Sanders Peirce, an American logician, spent 20 years modifying and expanding Boole's original system. He soon realized the immense potential it had if it were applied to digital circuitry. While he never actually applied the theory himself, a young student named Claude Shannon picked the idea up and did.</p>

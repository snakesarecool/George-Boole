    <h3>Religion</h3>
    <p> Boole was motivated in his research by his intense religious convictions. At the age of 17 he had a mystical experience in which he felt God called on him to explain how the mind processes thought. He decided to do this in a mathematical form, for the Glory of God.</p>

    <h3>Why is the Boolean algebra so important for computer science and digital circuitry?</h3>
    <p>Boolean algebra provides the basis for analyzing the validity of logical propositions because it captures the two-valued character (binary) of statements that may be either true or false. In the 1930s, a number of researchers noticed that Boole's two valued logic lent itself to a description of electrical switching circuits. They showed that the binary numbers (0 and 1), combined through Boolean algebra, could be used to analyze electrical switching circuits and thus used to design electronic computers. Today, digital computers and electronic circuits are designed to implement this binary arithmetic.</p>
    <p>George Boole's idea was revolutionary. Ironically, however, it was mostly criticized or ignored by his peers despite George Boole's great reputation. Charles Sanders Peirce, an American logician, spent 20 years modifying and expanding Boole's original system. He soon realized the immense potential it had if it were applied to digital circuitry. While he never actually applied the theory himself, a young student named Claude Shannon picked the idea up and did.</p>
